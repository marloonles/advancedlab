\title{Lab 3: Make a Heater and Measure Temperature}

\section{Introduction and Methods}
Current going through a resistor has the ability to generate enough heat to be measured. With a potentiometer, one can adjust the current that goes through the resistor. A thermistor then can be used to record the temperature changes resulting from the current changes. These elements attached to the breadboard are shown in the circuit diagram in Figure 1 and in the Arduino setup in Figure 2.

\section{Results and Discussion}
The resulting curve from the data collection can be found in Figure 3. Since the Arduino code started the collection at 0 for the potentiometer, it's likely that the plots being inverse of one another was because I started turning the potentiometer in the counterclockwise direction rather than clockwise.
